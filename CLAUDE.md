# CLAUDE.md — Project Guide for AI Assistants

## Project Overview

Viber's Toolkit — a personal productivity suite hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Two users (Bhaskar + wife). Multiple tools under one shell with hamburger menu navigation.

### Tools
- **Vibe Planner** — Kanban board + timeline for tasks/ideas (toolkit users)
- **ID Tracker** — Track identity documents (US + India) for family members, with expiry reminders (toolkit users)
- **Sunrisers HQ** — Expense tracking, dues, settlements for Sunrisers Manteca cricket team (cricket users)
- **Admin Dashboard** — User management, pending approvals, activity stats (admin only)

### Role-Based Access
The app supports multiple user roles with isolated experiences:

| Role | Tools visible | Signup | Branding |
|------|---------------|--------|----------|
| `toolkit` | Vibe Planner, Sports, ID Tracker | Auto-approved | Viber's Toolkit |
| `cricket` | Cricket Dashboard | Requires admin approval | Sunrisers Manteca |
| `admin` | All tools + Admin | Manual DB flag | Viber's Toolkit |

- Roles stored in `profiles.access` (text array, e.g. `{toolkit,cricket,admin}`)
- `profiles.approved` boolean — cricket signups start as `false` until admin approves
- Signup URL determines role: `/` → toolkit, `/cricket` → cricket
- `RoleGate` component enforces route-level protection
- `AuthGate` accepts `variant` prop (`toolkit` | `cricket`) for themed login pages
- Shell header and HamburgerMenu adapt branding based on URL path and user role

### Signup & Access Flows

**Player pre-added by admin → signs up on cricket:**
Admin adds player with email in `cricket_players` (`user_id: NULL`) → player signs up on `/cricket` with same email → `auth.users` record created → `profiles` record created with `access: {cricket}` → DB trigger `handle_new_user` checks `cricket_players` for email match → found → sets `profiles.approved: true`, links `cricket_players.user_id` → `create_welcome_post` RPC fires → welcome post + notifications created → player confirms email → signs in.

**Player pre-added by admin → already has toolkit account:**
Player tries signup on `/cricket` → email already registered → code checks `cricket_players` by email → match found → shows "You're on the team. Please sign in instead." → player signs in → `AuthGate` auto-approves, adds `cricket` to `profiles.access`, links `cricket_players.user_id` (via `ilike` email match where `user_id IS NULL`), creates welcome post → page reloads into cricket dashboard.

**Player linking on login (backup):**
On every login for cricket users, `auth-store.ts` runs: `UPDATE cricket_players SET user_id = auth_user_id WHERE email ILIKE auth_email AND user_id IS NULL AND is_active = true`. This is a backup linking mechanism in case the DB trigger or AuthGate flow missed it.

**Toolkit user tries cricket signup (not a player):**
Player tries signup on `/cricket` → email already registered → code checks `cricket_players` → no match → auto-calls `request_cricket_access` RPC (adds `cricket` to access, sets `approved: false`) → shows "Pending Approval" screen → admin approves or rejects.

**Random person signs up on cricket (no player record):**
Signs up on `/cricket` → no email match → `approved: false` → sees "Pending Approval" screen → admin sees in pending approvals bell:
- **Approve**: sets `profiles.approved: true`, creates `cricket_players` record from signup metadata, fires `create_welcome_post` RPC → welcome post + notifications → player can sign in.
- **Reject (pure cricket signup)**: fully deletes from `auth.users` + `profiles` via `reject_user` RPC → can sign up again fresh.
- **Reject (existing toolkit user)**: removes `cricket` from access array, restores `approved: true` → toolkit access preserved, cricket denied.

**Toolkit user signs in on cricket (not a player, didn't try signup first):**
Signs in on `/cricket` → `AuthGate` detects no cricket access → checks `cricket_players` → no match → shows "Request Cricket Access" screen → clicks request → `approved: false`, `cricket` added to access → admin approves or rejects from bell icon.

**IMPORTANT — AuthGate race condition guard:**
`AuthGate` only renders `RequestAccess` after `userAccess` has loaded from the profile (i.e., `userAccess.length > 0`). Without this, a brief window where `user` exists but `userAccess` is still `[]` would cause `RequestAccess` to render for existing users, re-triggering auto-approve + duplicate welcome posts.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |

## Database Schema

Table `profiles`: `id` (UUID, FK to auth.users), `email`, `full_name`, `is_admin`, `disabled`, `access` (text array, e.g. `{toolkit,cricket,admin}`), `approved` (boolean), `created_at`.

Table `vibes`: `id` (UUID), `user_id`, `text`, `status`, `category`, `time_spent`, `notes`, `due_date`, `position`, `completed_at`, `deleted_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
Statuses: `spark`, `in_progress`, `scheduled`, `done`. Soft delete via `deleted_at`.

Table `id_documents`: `id` (UUID), `user_id`, `id_type`, `country` (US/IN), `label`, `owner_name`, `description`, `expiry_date`, `renewal_url`, `reminder_days` (integer array), `created_at`, `updated_at`.

### Cricket Tables
Table `cricket_players`: `id`, `user_id` (UUID, nullable — NULL for admin-created players until the player signs up and links via email match), `name`, `jersey_number`, `phone`, `photo_url` (Supabase Storage public URL), `is_active`, `is_guest` (BOOLEAN, true for auto-created guest players from practice matches — can be promoted to roster via `promote_guest_to_roster` RPC), `created_at`, `updated_at`. Unique index on `lower(name) WHERE is_guest = true AND is_active = true` prevents duplicate guests.
Storage bucket `player-photos`: Public bucket for player profile photos. Path: `{user_id}/{player_id}.jpg`. Only the player themselves can upload (RLS by `auth.uid()`).
Table `cricket_seasons`: `id`, `user_id`, `name`, `year`, `season_type`, `share_token` (UUID for public URL), `is_active`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
Table `cricket_expenses`: `id`, `user_id`, `season_id`, `paid_by` (player FK), `category`, `description`, `amount` (NUMERIC), `expense_date`, `created_by` (TEXT), `updated_by` (TEXT), `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` (TEXT), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
Table `cricket_expense_splits`: `id`, `expense_id`, `player_id`, `share_amount` (NUMERIC). Junction table for equal splits.
Table `cricket_settlements`: `id`, `user_id`, `season_id`, `from_player`, `to_player`, `amount`, `settled_date`, `created_at`.
Table `cricket_season_fees`: `id`, `season_id`, `player_id`, `amount_paid` (NUMERIC), `paid_date`, `marked_by` (TEXT), `created_at`. Tracks per-player season fee payments (full/partial).
Table `cricket_sponsorships`: `id`, `season_id`, `sponsor_name`, `amount` (NUMERIC), `sponsored_date`, `notes`, `created_by` (TEXT), `updated_by` (TEXT), `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` (TEXT), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
Table `cricket_gallery`: `id`, `season_id`, `user_id`, `photo_url` (first photo, backward compat), `photo_urls` (TEXT array, multi-photo), `caption`, `posted_by` (TEXT), `deleted_at`, `created_at`.
Table `cricket_gallery_tags`: `id`, `post_id` (FK gallery), `player_id` (FK players), UNIQUE(post_id, player_id).
Table `cricket_gallery_comments`: `id`, `post_id` (FK gallery), `user_id`, `comment_by` (TEXT), `text`, `created_at`.
Table `cricket_gallery_likes`: `id`, `post_id` (FK gallery), `user_id`, UNIQUE(post_id, user_id).
Table `cricket_comment_reactions`: `id`, `comment_id` (FK gallery_comments), `user_id`, `emoji`, UNIQUE(comment_id, user_id, emoji).
Table `cricket_notifications`: `id`, `user_id`, `post_id` (FK gallery), `type` (tag/comment/like), `message`, `is_read`, `created_at`. Each user reads only their own (RLS by user_id).
Storage bucket `gallery-photos`: Public bucket for team gallery photos. Path: `{season_id}/{post_id}.jpg`. Any cricket user can upload.

### Player `user_id` Linking — CRITICAL
- `cricket_players.user_id` is **nullable**. Admin-created players start with `user_id: NULL`.
- When a player signs up/logs in, their `auth.users.id` is linked to `cricket_players.user_id` via **case-insensitive email match** (`ILIKE`) where `user_id IS NULL`.
- **Never set `user_id` to the admin's auth ID** when creating players — this was a past bug that caused wrong avatar/photo resolution across the app.
- Linking happens in 3 places: (1) DB trigger `handle_new_user` on signup, (2) `AuthGate` auto-approve flow, (3) `auth-store.ts` login backup.
- `user_id` is used to resolve player avatars in Moments (comments, likes, post headers). If `user_id` is wrong, the wrong photo shows.
- The `comment_by` and `posted_by` TEXT fields store the display name at time of action — but avatar resolution uses `user_id` → `cricket_players` → `photo_url`, NOT name matching (names can be ambiguous, e.g. "Venkat Kittu" vs "Venkat Subbu").

RPC: `get_public_season_data(token UUID)` — SECURITY DEFINER function returning all season data as JSON for the public share page.
RPC: `check_cricket_player_email(check_email TEXT)` — checks if a player exists with given email (for auto-approve on signup).
RPC: `get_signed_up_emails(check_emails TEXT[])` — SECURITY DEFINER function returning lowercase emails from auth.users that match the input array (case-insensitive). Used by PlayerManager to show signup status dots.
RPC: `create_welcome_post(new_user_id UUID, player_name TEXT)` — SECURITY DEFINER function that creates a welcome post in Moments + notifies all active players. Called by client on manual approval; also called internally by `handle_new_user` trigger for auto-approved players.

### Live Scoring Tables & Architecture

**Route:** `/cricket/scoring` — standalone full-screen page (not inside cricket dashboard tabs).
**Store:** `stores/scoring-store.ts` (Zustand) — full match lifecycle, ball-by-ball logic, computed stats.
**Types:** `types/scoring.ts` — `ScoringMatch`, `ScoringBall`, `ScoringInnings`, `BattingStats`, `BowlingStats`.
**Schema:** `docs/scoring-schema.sql` — 4 tables, 17 RPCs, reviewed by DBA/Arch/SQL agents.

#### Tables
Table `practice_matches`: `id`, `season_id`, `created_by`, `title`, `match_date`, `overs_per_innings`, `status` (setup/scoring/innings_break/completed), `current_innings` (0 or 1), `team_a_name`, `team_b_name`, `toss_winner`, `toss_decision`, `result_summary`, `match_winner`, `mvp_player_id`, `scorer_name`, `scorer_id`, `active_scorer_id`, `scorer_heartbeat`, `previous_match_id` (rematch link), `match_number`, `share_token` (public URL), `started_at`, `completed_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
Table `practice_match_players`: `id`, `match_id` (CASCADE), `player_id` (FK to cricket_players — set for ALL players including guests), `team` (team_a/team_b), `name`, `jersey_number`, `is_guest`, `is_captain`, `batting_order`, `created_at`. Match-local player snapshots — all ball references use these IDs, not global roster IDs.
Table `practice_innings`: `id`, `match_id` (CASCADE), `innings_number` (0 or 1), `batting_team`, `total_runs`, `total_wickets`, `total_overs`, `legal_balls`, `extras_wide`, `extras_no_ball`, `extras_bye`, `extras_leg_bye`, `striker_id`, `non_striker_id`, `bowler_id`, `target`, `is_completed`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. Denormalized totals updated after every ball for fast scoreboard reads.
Table `practice_balls`: `id`, `match_id` (CASCADE), `innings_number`, `sequence`, `over_number`, `ball_in_over`, `striker_id`, `non_striker_id`, `bowler_id`, `runs_bat` (0-7), `runs_extras`, `extras_type` (wide/no_ball/bye/leg_bye), `is_legal`, `is_free_hit`, `is_wicket`, `wicket_type` (bowled/caught/run_out/stumped/hit_wicket/retired), `dismissed_id`, `fielder_id`, `deleted_at` (soft delete for undo), `created_at`. Every delivery is an immutable row.

#### Key Constraints
- Wicket consistency: `is_wicket=true` requires `wicket_type` to be set
- Wide/no-ball must have `runs_extras >= 1`
- Toss: both `toss_winner` and `toss_decision` set together or both null
- Ball sequence: partial unique index `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` (allows undo/redo)
- Players: partial unique on `(match_id, player_id, team) WHERE player_id IS NOT NULL` — allows same guest on both teams
- Overs validation: decimal part 0-5 only
- `created_by` immutable via trigger

#### RLS Policies
- **Read**: All cricket users can read all 4 tables
- **Write (balls/innings)**: Only `active_scorer_id` or `created_by`, AND match must be in `scoring`/`innings_break` status (blocked after completion)
- **Delete matches**: Creator or admin (CASCADE cleans up children)
- **Admin**: Can delete from any table regardless of match status (cleanup)

#### RPCs
- `create_practice_match(...)` → atomic: creates match + players + innings in one transaction, upserts guest players into `cricket_players` (ON CONFLICT dedup by `lower(name)`), returns server player ID mapping
- `get_match_history(status, limit, offset)` → paginated match list with both innings scores (landing page)
- `get_match_scorecard(match_id)` → full data dump: match + players + innings + balls (scorecard view)
- `get_public_match_scorecard(share_token)` → no-auth public view, internal IDs stripped
- `claim_scorer(match_id, name)` → atomic handoff with row-level lock (`FOR UPDATE NOWAIT`)
- `release_scorer(match_id)` → release scoring rights (self, creator, or admin)
- `get_rematch_template(match_id)` → pre-fill teams/players for back-to-back matches
- `get_practice_leaderboard(season_id, category, match_limit)` → season stats with optional last-N-matches filter: batting (runs, SR, 4s/6s), bowling (wickets, economy, excludes byes/leg-byes), fielding (sorted by total dismissals), all-rounder (combined score with matches count)
- `soft_delete_match(match_id, deleter_name)` → soft-delete (sets deleted_at), creator or admin only
- `restore_match(match_id)` → restores soft-deleted match, creator or admin only
- `permanent_delete_match(match_id)` → hard delete with CASCADE (admin only, requires deleted_at IS NOT NULL)
- `get_deleted_matches(limit)` → admin-only list of soft-deleted matches for Deleted filter tab
- `revert_match_to_scoring(match_id)` → admin-only, reverts abruptly ended match (no winner) back to scoring/innings_break. Smart logic: if 2nd innings has players → scoring, if 1st completed → innings_break, else scoring
- `get_guest_suggestions()` → returns `{id, name}` from `cricket_players WHERE is_guest = true` for autocomplete in wizard
- `promote_guest_to_roster(player_id, jersey, phone, email)` → admin-only, flips `is_guest=false`, validates email uniqueness, stats carry over
- `get_match_scorecard` returns `striker_id`, `non_striker_id`, `bowler_id` in innings data (needed for match resume)

#### Sync Architecture (Optimistic Local-First)
- **Match creation**: Awaited — must complete before scoring starts (need server player IDs for FK references)
- **Every ball**: Fire-and-forget — INSERT ball + UPDATE innings in background. If fails, toast warning, ball stays local.
- **Undo**: Fire-and-forget — UPDATE ball `deleted_at` + UPDATE innings totals
- **End match**: Awaited — UPDATE match status/result
- **Handoff**: Awaited — `claim_scorer` RPC with row lock
- **Match resume** (new device / page refresh): Call `get_match_scorecard` to hydrate store (includes striker/bowler IDs), then `claim_scorer` for RLS write access. "Continue Scoring" always re-hydrates from DB to avoid stale localStorage.
- **Stale match detection**: On landing mount, auto-verifies local match with server via `resumeMatch`. If match was completed/deleted on another device, `reset()` clears localStorage + sessionStorage. Sync button on active match card for manual check. "Resume Scoring" button on DB active match cards for multi-device handoff. Only one active match allowed at a time (blocks "Start New Match" when any active match exists in local store or DB).
- **End match result logic**: Only declares winner when both innings completed naturally (`is_completed` on both). Mid-innings abort = "No result". `endInnings` on 2nd innings delegates to `endMatch` for proper result computation. `match_winner` always derived from scores.
- **Revert match**: Admin can revert abruptly ended (no winner) matches. Smart status: if 2nd innings has players → `scoring`, if 1st innings completed → `innings_break`, else `scoring`.
- **Spectators**: Subscribe to Supabase Realtime on `practice_matches` + `practice_innings` for live score updates (planned)

#### Scoring UI Components
- `ScoringWizard.tsx` — 5-step setup (match details → Team A → Team B → toss → opening players)
- `ScoringScreen.tsx` — main scoring interface (scoreboard + batsmen/bowler + over timeline + button grid + tabs)
- `ButtonGrid.tsx` — premium scoring pad (circular run buttons, gradient boundaries, wicket bar, extras, undo/redo/end)
- `Scoreboard.tsx` — gradient score display (team, runs/wickets, overs, run rate, target)
- `OverTimeline.tsx` — colored ball circles for current over (3-tone: gray runs, blue boundaries, red wickets, amber extras)
- `BallByBallLog.tsx` — reverse chronological timeline with over summaries, innings break cards, match result card
- `FullScorecard.tsx` — batting table + bowling table + fall of wickets
- `WicketSheet.tsx` — multi-step Dialog: dismissal type → fielder → new batsman (handles all-out)
- `ExtrasSheet.tsx` — Dialog for wide/no-ball/bye with run selection
- `EndOfOverSheet.tsx` — Dialog showing bowling figures + next bowler selection
- `CoinFlipPage.tsx` — 3D coin flip animation with Web Audio sound effects, Continue/Flip Again buttons (wizard step 4a)
- `TossPage.tsx` — premium toss result page: hero image, team card tap targets, bat/bowl decision with gradient highlights (wizard step 4b)
- `FreeHitBanner.tsx` — subtle cricket-themed banner after no-ball
- `PostMatchSummary.tsx` — result screen with gradient hero, both innings scores, scorecard link
- `scoring-utils.ts` — type converters between store (ScoringBall) and UI (BallResult, TimelineEntry, InningsSummary)
- `PageFooter.tsx` — shared "Designed by Bhaskar Mantrala" footer (used across cricket + scoring)

## Design System (`components/ui/`)

Shared UI components following the **shadcn/ui pattern** (copy-paste, own-the-code) with CVA for type-safe variants, Radix UI for accessible primitives, and sonner for toast notifications.

### Stack
- **CVA** (class-variance-authority) — Type-safe variant definitions for components
- **Radix UI** — Accessible primitives (Dialog with focus trap, keyboard nav, ARIA)
- **sonner** — Toast notifications with theme integration
- **cn()** (`lib/utils.ts`) — Class merging via clsx + tailwind-merge
- **BrandProvider** (`lib/brand.tsx`) — React context for toolkit (purple) / cricket (sky blue/navy) theming
- **Toolkit theme** is configurable via 4 CSS variables in `globals.css`: `--toolkit`, `--toolkit-accent`, `--toolkit-hover`, `--toolkit-glow` — change these to rebrand the entire toolkit (Vibe Planner, ID Tracker, Sports, Admin)
- **Cricket theme** is configurable via 4 CSS variables in `globals.css`: `--cricket`, `--cricket-accent`, `--cricket-hover`, `--cricket-glow` — change these to rebrand the entire cricket app
- Both themes are independent — cricket can move to a separate repo without affecting toolkit

```

### Brand Context
Components auto-detect brand from `BrandProvider`. Cricket pages use orange, toolkit uses purple.
```tsx
<BrandProvider brand="cricket">
  <Button variant="primary">Save</Button>  {/* orange gradient */}
</BrandProvider>
```

### Rules for New Components
1. **Always use shared components** — never inline Tailwind for buttons, inputs, modals, alerts
2. **Use `cn()` for conditional classes** — never string concatenation
3. **Use CVA for new variants** — define in the component file, export the variants function
4. **Use Radix Dialog** for modals — never hand-roll overlay + panel + close button
5. **Use `toast()`** for user feedback — every create/update/delete action should confirm success or report failure
6. **Use `<Text>`** for ALL text elements — never use raw `text-[Xpx]` Tailwind classes. The Text component enforces the 7-size type scale (2xs/xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl) and prevents typography inconsistency.
6. **Use shared `Drawer`** for bottom sheets — never use raw `vaul` directly. The shared Drawer handles iOS Safari keyboard, scroll-to-dismiss, and viewport issues automatically via `useKeyboardHeight` hook.
7. **Viewport zoom is disabled** (`maximumScale: 1, userScalable: false` in `app/layout.tsx`) — appropriate for web app, prevents accidental pinch-zoom on iOS

## Key Architecture

- **Static export** (`output: 'export'`) — no server-side code at runtime
- **All Supabase calls are client-side** via `@supabase/ssr` browser client
- **Zustand stores** — `auth-store.ts` (auth state, login/signup/reset, role/access), `vibe-store.ts` (vibes CRUD, UI state), `id-tracker-store.ts` (ID documents CRUD), `cricket-store.ts` (players, seasons, expenses, splits, settlements, gallery/moments)
- **Moments feed** — Gallery/GalleryPost/GalleryUpload components use `motion/react` for animations (double-tap heart, post entrance), `vaul` for bottom sheet menus (post actions, comment actions, liked-by, confirm delete, upload), `@formkit/auto-animate` for comment list animations, `lucide-react` for icons
- **Role-based access** — `profiles.access` array determines tool visibility; `RoleGate` component for route protection; `AuthGate` variant prop for themed login
- **RLS enforced** — every query filters by `user_id`, server-side RLS as backup
- **Soft delete** — `deleted_at` column, Recently Deleted UI with restore (vibes, practice matches); `is_active` flag for cricket players. Practice matches support soft-delete → restore → permanent delete (CASCADE) with admin-only Recently Deleted section.
- **Public pages** — `/cricket/dues/` public share page bypasses auth, uses SECURITY DEFINER RPC function
- **Feature branches** — develop on branches, merge to `main` only when ready to deploy

## Git Workflow

- Use **feature branches** (e.g., `feat/sports-toss`), not direct push to main
- Main branch auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages — limited build quota
- Commit convention: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`

## Bug Fixing — MANDATORY Process

When a user reports an issue is **not resolved after a fix attempt**, do NOT immediately try another quick fix. Instead:

1. **Stop and form an agent council** — Launch 2-3 specialist agents in parallel to research the root cause deeply (iOS Safari behavior, library GitHub issues, how production apps solve it, codebase analysis)
2. **Wait for all agents to report back** — Synthesize findings before writing any code
3. **Present the solution plan** — Explain the root cause and proposed fix to the user before implementing
4. **One permanent fix** — Never push iterative band-aids. Each failed attempt erodes trust and wastes deploy quota.

This applies especially to:
- iOS Safari / mobile browser issues (keyboard, viewport, scroll, touch)
- Cross-platform rendering differences
- Animation/positioning bugs (dialog repositioning, drawer conflicts)
- Auth flow edge cases

## Shared Components — MANDATORY Check

Before writing ANY UI code, check `components/ui/` for an existing shared component. NEVER duplicate what already exists.

**Available shared components** (always use these instead of inline Tailwind):
- `Text` — ALL text elements (headings, body, labels, captions)
- `Button` — ALL buttons (primary, secondary, danger, ghost, link)
- `Input` — ALL form inputs (with label, error, brand focus)
- `PasswordInput` — Password fields (eye toggle + requirements)
- `Alert` — ALL error/success/warning banners
- `Card` — ALL bordered card containers
- `Badge` — ALL status pills/tags
- `Label` — ALL form labels (regular + uppercase)
- `Dialog` — ALL centered modals
- `Drawer` — ALL bottom sheets
- `Spinner` — ALL loading indicators
- `Skeleton` — ALL loading placeholders
- `EmptyState` — ALL empty data screens
- `FilterDropdown` — ALL category filters with counts
- `CardMenu` — ALL three-dot dropdown menus (never hand-roll portal menus)
- `RefreshButton` — ALL manual refresh actions (self-managed spinner, `bordered` or `glass` variant)
- `CapsuleTabs` — ALL primary tab navigation (expandable capsule with icon+text, gradient, animation)
- `SegmentedControl` — ALL sub-view toggles (matching capsule design: gradient, rounded-full, glow)
- `toast` (sonner) — ALL user feedback notifications

**If a component doesn't exist for your need:** Create it in `components/ui/`, add to `index.ts` barrel export, document in this section, then use it.

## QA Before Presenting to User — MANDATORY

Before presenting ANY code change to the user for review:
1. **Run tests** — `npx vitest run` must pass
2. **Run build** — `npx next build` must pass with zero errors
3. **Verify on localhost** — Mentally trace through the change on desktop AND mobile viewports
4. **Check edge cases** — What happens when the data is empty? What about dark/light mode? What about iOS Safari?
5. **Test the interaction** — If it's a modal, does it open AND close properly? If it's a button, does clicking it work? If it's a form, does submit + cancel both work?

Never present a half-tested change. The user should not be finding basic bugs like "modal doesn't close" or "wrong brand color".

## Testing — MANDATORY

**ALWAYS update or add unit tests when changing code.** Tests live in `tests/unit/` and use Vitest.

```bash
npm test                # Run all tests with verbose output + JUnit report
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode during development
npm run test:coverage   # Tests + coverage report (text + HTML)
npm run test:report     # Full report → open test-results/coverage/index.html
npx next build          # Must pass before pushing
```

- **Console**: verbose pass/fail per test with logs
- **JUnit XML**: `test-results/junit-report.xml` (CI-compatible)
- **HTML Coverage**: `test-results/coverage/index.html` (open in browser)

### Test Structure
| File | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| `tests/unit/auth-helpers.test.ts` | `lib/auth.ts` — error sanitization, password validation, rate limiting |
| `tests/unit/auth-store-init.test.ts` | Auth store init(), token flows, onAuthStateChange, checkProfileAndSetUser |
| `tests/unit/welcome-messages.test.ts` | Welcome message generation and @mention captions |
| `tests/unit/cricket-store-core.test.ts` | Players, seasons, expenses, settlements, fees, sponsorships (local mode) |
| `tests/unit/cricket-store-gallery.test.ts` | Gallery posts, comments, likes, reactions, notifications (local mode) |
| `tests/unit/cricket-store-cloud.test.ts` | All cricket store Supabase cloud-mode paths + ID reconciliation |
| `tests/unit/vibe-store.test.ts` | Vibe planner CRUD, timer, trash, views (local mode) |
| `tests/unit/vibe-store-cloud.test.ts` | Vibe store Supabase cloud-mode paths |
| `tests/unit/id-tracker-store.test.ts` | ID document CRUD (local mode) |
| `tests/unit/id-tracker-store-cloud.test.ts` | ID tracker Supabase cloud-mode paths |
| `tests/unit/lib-storage.test.ts` | localStorage load/save utilities |
| `tests/unit/lib-nav.test.ts` | Navigation config and role assignments |
| `tests/unit/lib-supabase-client.test.ts` | Supabase client singleton and null guards |
| `tests/integration/signup-flows.test.ts` | All 6 signup/access flows + login + password + edge cases |

### Mock Setup
- Supabase client is mocked via `vi.mock('@/lib/supabase/client')` — stores run in local-only mode
- Fixtures in `tests/mocks/fixtures.ts` — shared test data for all suites
- Supabase query builder mock in `tests/mocks/supabase.ts`
- Store state is reset in `beforeEach` using fixtures

### Rules
- Every new store action MUST have a corresponding test
- Every bug fix SHOULD include a regression test
- Run `npx vitest run && npx next build` before every push

## Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Automated Backups
- **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/backup.yml`) runs daily at 11 PM PT
- Exports all 16 tables as JSON to private repo `vibe-planner-backups`
- Keeps last 30 days, auto-deletes older backups
- Can trigger manually: Actions → Daily Supabase Backup → Run workflow
- Secrets required: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `VIBE_PLANNER_BACKUP` (GitHub PAT)

### Restore Process (if Supabase project is lost)
1. **Create new Supabase project** — note the new URL and keys
2. **Restore schema** — run `docs/cricket-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (creates tables, RLS policies, RPCs, triggers)
3. **Generate restore SQL** — Actions → Generate Restore SQL → Run workflow → enter date or "latest"
4. **Download artifact** — download the `.sql` file from the workflow run
5. **Restore data** — paste the SQL into Supabase SQL Editor and execute
6. **Update credentials** — update `.env.local` with new `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
7. **Update GitHub secrets** — update `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in repo settings
8. **Storage images** — NOT backed up. Player photos and gallery photos would need to be re-uploaded.

### What's Backed Up vs Not

| Backed up | Not backed up |
|-----------|---------------|
| All table data (JSON) | Storage bucket images |
| Schema + RPCs + triggers (git) | Auth user passwords/sessions |
| RLS policies (git) | Supabase project config |

## Security — MANDATORY Pre-Commit Checks

**ALWAYS run this before every commit:**

1. **Scan for secrets** — no Supabase URLs, API keys, passwords, or emails in committed files:
   ```bash
   git diff --cached | grep -iE "mcklzjmaivtwdhjauwtv|sb_publishable|Welcome|bmantrala@" && echo "SECRETS FOUND!" || echo "CLEAN"
   ```

2. **Verify .gitignore** — these must NEVER be committed:
   - `.env.local` (Supabase credentials)
   - `.claude/` (may contain credentials in settings)
   - `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `out/`
   - `vibe-planner/config.js` (old vanilla JS credentials)

3. **Test files** — must use `process.env.TEST_EMAIL` / `process.env.TEST_PASSWORD`, never hardcoded credentials

4. **Build check** — `npx next build` must pass with zero errors before pushing

## Documentation — MANDATORY Updates

When making changes, ALWAYS update these files if affected:

1. **`docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql`** — if any SQL changes (new tables, columns, policies, functions, triggers)
2. **`docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`** — if any config/setup changes (env vars, build settings, new tables)
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** — if architecture, commands, or workflow changes
4. **`README.md`** — if features, tech stack, or project structure changes
5. **`.env.example`** — if any new environment variables are added

## SQL Changes — MANDATORY Agent Review

For ANY change to SQL schema files (`docs/*.sql`), you MUST:

1. **Get reviewed by DBA agent** — check data integrity, constraints, indexes, performance
2. **Get reviewed by Architecture agent** — check RLS policies, security, access control, data flow
3. **Get reviewed by SQL specialist agent** — check query correctness, function safety, injection vectors
4. Run all three reviews BEFORE committing. Fix all CRITICAL and HIGH issues. Document any accepted MEDIUM/LOW risks.

## Adding a New Tool

1. Create folder under `app/(tools)/your-tool/`
2. Add `page.tsx` inside it
3. Add entry to `lib/nav.ts` with `roles` array specifying which user roles can see it
4. Create Zustand store in `stores/` if the tool has data
5. Create types in `types/` for TypeScript definitions
6. Wrap page content in `<AuthGate>` (with optional `variant` for themed login)
7. Wrap page content in `<RoleGate allowed={['role1', 'admin']}>` for access control
8. Test locally with `npm run dev`
9. Push to feature branch, create PR, merge when ready

## Email (Resend + Supabase SMTP)

Transactional emails (signup confirmation, password reset) are sent via **Resend** as the custom SMTP provider for Supabase Auth.

### Setup
1. **Resend account** — resend.com (free tier: 3,000 emails/month, no credit card)
2. **Domain verified** — `viberstoolkit.com` with SPF/DKIM/DMARC DNS records (auto-configured via Cloudflare)
3. **Supabase SMTP config** — Dashboard → Authentication → Email (SMTP Settings):
   - Host: `smtp.resend.com`
   - Port: `465`
   - Username: `resend`
   - Password: Resend API key (`re_...`)
   - Sender: `noreply@viberstoolkit.com`
   - Sender name: `Viber's Toolkit`

### How It Works
- Supabase Auth composes emails using templates in `docs/email-templates/`
- Resend delivers them via SMTP — it's a transport layer only
- Resend **never sees passwords** — only the rendered HTML with reset/confirm links
- Emails from `noreply@viberstoolkit.com` (not `noreply@mail.supabase.io`)

### Troubleshooting
- **Rate limit**: Supabase has 60-second minimum interval per user
- **Spam folder**: New domains start with low reputation — ask users to mark as "Not spam" and add `noreply@viberstoolkit.com` to contacts
- **Delivery status**: Check Resend dashboard → Emails tab for sent/delivered/bounced
- **Cache-busting**: If changing email templates, Supabase caches them — wait a few minutes or restart project

## Email Templates

Branded email templates are in `docs/email-templates/`:
- `reset-password.html` — Password reset (uses `{{ .RedirectTo }}` + `{{ .TokenHash }}` for cross-browser support)
- `confirm-signup.html` — Signup confirmation
- `password-changed.html` — Password change notification (for future custom SMTP)

Configure in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Email Templates.
